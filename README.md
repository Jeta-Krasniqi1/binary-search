# binary-search
This Java program implements a recursive binary search algorithm on a sorted list of integers. The user inputs a list of numbers, which is then sorted automatically. The program then searches for a target number using binary search and returns its index (or a message if not found).
🔧 How It Works

The user inputs the number of elements in the list.

The user enters the elements of the list.

The program sorts the list.

The user inputs a target number to search for.

The program uses recursive binary search to find the target number.

If found, it prints the index; otherwise, it prints a message that the number is not in the list.

🚀 Example Usage

🛠 Technologies Used

Java (for implementation)
