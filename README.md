# binary-search
This Java program implements a recursive binary search algorithm on a sorted list of integers. The user inputs a list of numbers, which is then sorted automatically. The program then searches for a target number using binary search and returns its index (or a message if not found).
## ðŸ”§ How It Works:

The user inputs the number of elements in the list.

The user enters the elements of the list.

The program sorts the list.     

The user inputs a target number to search for.

The program uses recursive binary search to find the target number.

If found, it prints the index; otherwise, it prints a message that the number is not in the list.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java (for implementation)
- Scanner (for user input handling)
- ArrayList (for dynamic list storage)
- Collections (for sorting)
